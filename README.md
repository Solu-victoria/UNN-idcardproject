Educational institutions in developing countries is a vast sector and it is expanding rapidly. With the rapid growth of technologies, educational institutions are still lagging behind. For identification of students/staff they still rely on manuals who knows who, a student can pass a very important staff and not know. If a proper ID card system is introduced then it would be much easier to identify and verify a staff or a student within and outside the institution. Also, problems that may arise as a result of collection time will be solved by an interactive system where students or staff get notified when their cards are due for collection. Therefore, in this research, I implemented an automated staff and student ID card system. I tried my best to make the right implementation of QR code on the staff and student ID cards. QR code is attached to the ID card and holdersâ€™ personal details can be found by scanning the QR code with smartphones (downloaded & installed QR reader software). The research will briefly analyze the existing system and use the idea to implement a more efficient system. The methodological approach used is OOADM on a VS code IDE on a windows 10 system using Laravel PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL database technologies.
